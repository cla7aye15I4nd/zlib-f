# Project status and remaining work

[Documentation](README.md) · [API](api/README.md) · [Checking](checking/README.md)

**Work in progress. Full zlib verification is not complete.**
This is the single current-status and remaining-work page.
The first target is the default LP64 Linux static build with the default allocator.
Other upstream configurations remain goals. Compiler/OS correctness and performance
are outside the proof.

## Recorded checkpoint

The inventory has 95 default-build API entries, four lifecycle targets and four
initialisation-domain targets. A proposition's presence is not a proof.
The last recorded registry report recognizes five goals: format determinism,
prefix freedom, a deferred-distance model witness, `gzclearerr`, and
`inflateCodesUsed`. See [the contract review](checking/contract-review.md).
This is a recorded checkpoint, not a fresh audit of each development edit.

Recorded local work also covers version/flags/error/bound/CRC-table queries;
gzip EOF, buffering, offsets and error queries; inflate state, mark and priming
queries; deflate used-bit, tuning, header and pending queries; internal fast-decoder
safety, bit-source composition and token-output refinement; and canonical-code/leaf/heap tree prefixes.
Further local proofs cover `gzrewind`, `inflateGetHeader`, `inflateResetKeep`,
`inflateReset`, `inflateReset2`, `inflateEnd`, `inflateBackEnd`, `deflateEnd` and
`deflateGetDictionary`. Their direct source mutants fail the corresponding function proofs.
Source-order corrections and direct proof mutants accompany their stated scopes.
These results do not complete public inflate/deflate or arbitrary call-sequence
correctness. Registration, reviewed locks and acceptance on a named commit remain
separate. A build count is not a completion percentage.

## Remaining work

### Integration

Review the focused function-manual scopes and regenerate the documentation source-policy lock in a
reviewed audit update. Independently review the new source and kernel-syntax locks and the first
verification baseline. Maintain repository protections for the four checks and protected-path
review. Register newly checked results only after their required checks.

### Public contracts

Independently approve the 103 target statements, caller domains and representation limits before
accepting a verification baseline. Extend the ordinary data-epoch refinement to advanced raw
dictionary replacement and all header/priming/recovery combinations; retain their exact per-entry
effects and unconditional sequence safety. No final correctness claim may silently drop those
obligations.

### Specification review

Review the corrected shared `Uncompress2` relation independently. The deferred-distance and
exact-free corrections have independent counterexamples and checked regression proofs;
implementation refinement remains open. Its former empty-output clause on memory failure and
extension clause on buffer error have been removed using the existing paired counterexample.
Complete the older abstract gz and dictionary models before using them as complete operational
refinements; the concrete public targets do not assume their callee contracts.

### Translation review

Continue the statement-by-statement review beyond the corrected compressor automatic storage. The
checked signed-subtraction correction for the compressor slide still needs migration with its
regression. The source-level selected-depth reread in tree merging has been restored with a
[six-case regression](../tests/regression/trees-depth-read/README.md) and a required structural
check that rejects the former cached expression. Prove the temporal initialization history of
internal depth reads. Review scalar-pointer aliasing and the null-minus-null special case in
compressor pointer subtraction (**to confirm**).

### CRC address model

Extend and independently review address/alignment semantics for represented static and embedded byte
objects. The current CRC `addrOf` helper rejects a valid 47-byte read from the static distance
table; a [checked diagnostic](../tests/verification/counterexamples/crc-static-address.lean) records
the counterexample. The broad public checksum domain remains fixed; this is a translation-model
blocker, not a confirmed upstream bug. A fixed gzip execution with 47 output bytes in an embedded
array also reaches this model fault. Its complete public-history/domain witness remains **to confirm**.

### Inflate causal model

Complete the universal output and unknown-dictionary refinement against the C. The earlier
whole-lookahead consistency is false; the supporting-bit-prefix correction is reviewed. The fixed
data-error detection lag of eight bytes also has a counterexample; derive a justified replacement
rather than raising the constant without proof. Register the checked `inflate_decodes` model proof,
then establish these conditions for actual decoder runs. Prove the general negative-value priming
bridge, beyond the checked model witnesses and finite execution matrix.

### Differential harness

Keep the new allocation-failure and negative-prime regressions in automated validation. The
test-owned gz handles, input line and deflate buffers are now released. Normal and unsuppressed
sanitizer runs compare all 47,890 inputs. A cleanup mutation confirms that the harness still reports
library state leaked by a missing end call.

### Proof mutants

Complete the remaining legacy lists. Every newly proved public entry must supply direct translation
mutants in the locked mapping and demonstrate failure in its function proof. Unproved entries
acquire their records with their proofs.

### Decode tables

Connect the proved canonical-code coverage and entry-shape lemmas to the heap written by
`inflate_table`; establish the table predicates used by the decoders.

### Inflate

The locally checked internal fast body now emits one independent literal/copy token, ends the
block, or rejects an invalid length code, invalid distance code or too-far match without output.
The actual distance result preserves exact remaining bits and equates copying with independent
bytewise history copying. The token relation has checked composition, decomposition and rejection
results against the original format grammar. Whole-fast-call bit origin also checks through the
loop, byte rollback and final writeback. All these results retain the original safety conclusions.

Establish table meaning, suffix stability, compatible leaf flags and saved-window history from
actual construction, installation and init. Complete whole-fast-call output composition and cover
all legal buffer views. Finish the other decode modes, across-call composition, copy and recovery.
These remain internal-domain results, not registered public proofs. The public inflate and sequence
goals remain open.

### Inflate back

Finish table construction, compressed blocks, callback composition and the complete function.

### Deflate

Finish initialisation and its failure cleanup, dictionary setting, priming, copying, `fill_window`,
strategy loops and the complete function. The recovered dictionary-query proof builds and rejects
three translation mutants in its own proof; registration remains.

### Trees

The actual `gen_codes` now has a checked internal execution proof. Its two loops terminate, account
for unsigned wrapping, assign each positive-length symbol its reversed canonical word, and preserve
all lengths and every field outside the selected code cells. Array bounds and the fifteen-bit length
limit remain explicit internal premises for the constructor to establish. Three synchronized
starting-code, next-code and stored-code mutations fail the execution proofs while complete source
equality still checks independently. The actual descriptor/reset/scan/two-leaf-repair prefix also
has a checked execution proof. It establishes distinct live leaves from unrestricted old heap
contents, lengths and depths, and records at most two repairs and their exact unsigned cost effects.
A complete source equality connects this prefix to the unchanged remaining function; that equality
does not prove the remaining execution. Eleven scan, reset and repair mutants fail their execution
proofs while the complete source equality checks independently. The actual ordered prefix now stores
the exact descriptor maximum and executes the complete heapify loop on the same state. It derives
node bounds from the prepared leaves, preserves their permutation and array capacity, frames cells
outside the populated interval, and establishes heap order and a minimal root. The called sift-down
execution is proved, not assumed. Five heapify and descriptor-store mutants fail their execution
proofs while the complete source equality still checks independently. The new results are not
registered or CI-approved. Finish tree construction, tree emission, block compression and the
overlay bound, including the small memory levels.

### Other APIs

Finish the compression utilities and the gz read/write/open paths.

### End-to-end claims

Instantiate the heap API, connect the history invariant to the format model, and prove sequence
safety, ownership, termination and functional correctness on the supported configurations.

### Historical reports to recheck

Recheck gzip extra-length arithmetic, partial-read recovery, negative-position
seeking, lost parameter changes, failed-finish recovery and forward seek after EOF
against the current pin. Conditional seek fault lemmas do not prove reachability:
establish signed-position and borrowed-pointer conditions from actual call histories.
The `inflateBack` history report remains unconfirmed for that callback API;
ordinary-inflate sanitizer examples do not settle it.
The external string allocator and fixed loop fuel also need review before full
gzip ownership or arbitrary finite callback termination is claimed.
A suspected defect is not permission to exclude a public case.
[Findings](findings.md) records evidence and confidence; current patches are in
[patches/README.md](../patches/README.md). No blanket UB patch is applied.

The [architecture guide](design/architecture.md#design-decisions) records design decisions
D1–D6, including D5's fresh-memory choice cited by the generated schema.

## Objectives

| ID | Required property |
| --- | --- |
| P1 | Safety and no leaks. |
| P2 | Termination without fuel exhaustion. |
| P3 | Frame: only permitted storage changes. |
| P4 | Invariants and ownership across legal call sequences. |
| P5 | Functional correctness against independent specifications. |
| P6 | Coverage of every upstream CI configuration. |
| C1 | Checksum updates and combinations match their definitions. |
| C2 | Decoding produces justified prefixes, completes under stated conditions and safely reports detected invalid data; memory failure and incomplete input remain explicit. |
| C3 | Completed compression encodes accepted input; compatible decoding recovers it across permitted parameters, splits and flushes. |
| C4 | Header capture and dictionary checks have exact API effects; checksum equality is not dictionary byte equality. |
| C5 | Output-bound adequacy under its documented conditions, separately from numeric equality. |
| C6 | Independent copied ownership and matching continuation; specified reset behaviour. |
| C7 | Gzip data, positions and cleanup across read/write/seek/close histories. |

## Working rules

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| R1 | Prove actual callees; never assume their contracts. |
| R2 | Init establishes the shared invariant; top-level claims also need witnesses. |
| R3 | Carry safety and functional history through the same actual states. |
| R4 | Connect execution, translation and independent specifications by refinement. |
| R5 | Allowed axioms only; no placeholders or unchecked proof shortcuts. |
| R6 | State narrower domains explicitly and record them in deviations. |
| R7 | Correct translation mismatches for fidelity, never to ease a proof. |
| R8 | Retain C naming/source correspondence; separate heap-free mathematics. |

## Acceptance

Fix the questions, review the baseline, prove exact targets with init/non-vacuity
and proof mutants, then pass final checks on a named commit. The
[checking guide](checking/README.md) defines each stage. Tests are finite evidence.
